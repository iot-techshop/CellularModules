Comparing Cellular Modules for your IoT Project

Here is a comparison of various cellular modules that you frequently see available online. Always analyze the detailed specifications before making your design selection, but based on my experience there are some to avoid and some to move towards.
In general, I would avoid any module that only supports 2G or 3g networks. My opinion has nothing to do with speed, but with the moving away from 2 and 3G networks in many regions. Those that have not yet fully shut down 2G or 3G suppport, are on their way to doing so.
The other issue with those technologies is that they are hungry power hogs. If you are developing a remotely deployed battery operated device, you will generally be able to get 5 or more times the battery life from 4G CATM1 and even more with NB IoT devices.
Now, NBioT devices are not the answer to everything. There are still many, many areas that do not yet support it. And the other issue is they should only be used for fixed solutions, like a vending machine or parking meter. They do not play well with switching cell towers. NEVER use NBIot for mobile or vehicle tracking devices, or anything that will be moving from cell to cell.
Most of all, verify that any area you plan to deploy your device within, supports the network requirements of your device.
Some detailed comparisons below. RED means don't buy or use, Green means go, and Yellow means proceed with caution.
CAUTION: One other point, when you order a module or board with a module, make sure to order the correct one for your country. Generally a suffix of 'A' means the Americas, 'C' China, 'E' Europe and 'G; Global. Note that on Alibaba and other places you see many with the 'C' suffix at much lower prices. Avoid them unless you are designing for China as they will not work in most other countries.
